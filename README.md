OVERVIEW
=======
Amanuensis is a modern, cross-platform replacement for the original closed-source Scribius.app — an application that tracks data from logs in an old game called Clan Lord. This project reverse-engineered Scribius and ported it to Rust (core + CLI) with a Tauri + React GUI, providing a backwards-compatible app that works on Mac, Linux, and Windows.

The original application is Scribius.app in this folder.
